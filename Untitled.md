- make sure that i resolve periodic notes, daily note and calendar plugin, along with other systems like forever journals and access system
- yyyy-mm-dd will be daily notes (timestamping)
- daily reviews are the "daily note" in the forever journal system
- daily, weekly, monthly, quaterly and yearly reviews are under calendar compass
- calendar notes holds time based notes like masterclasses, minutes, and daily timestamping notes
- kepano uses his daily note plugin as a base to catchall notes that have some kind of relation to the date itself 

need to check with chatgpt or reddit if there's anyway to combine them into the way i want to use, otherwise i think there's a slight work around.

for example, i find that what kepano does is really useful because you can go back to the particular day and figure out any notes related to that particular day in time, so his daily note is specific (yyyy-mm-dd) in my case, it will be the daily timestamping note under calendar notes folder.

but i want the usefulness of forever journal to come into play so those daily reviews are named dd mmmm so that no matter the year, i can always revisit.

the issue comes where

Most people visit Bali but miss this place... Sumba, Indonesia.

A well-kept secret among travellers that isn't your typical tourist island, and we were first drawn to Sumba for its epic Icelandic landscapes that look straight out of a Wes Anderson film!

What makes Sumba really stand out is unlike more more commercialised areas in Indonesia like it's neighbour Bali (just an hour flight away), it is raw, authnetic and still mostly untouched by mass tourism.

It's so remote and unknown that we practically had the whole island to ourselves. We were able to discover off the map beaches, learn about unique cultures and connect with the locals  at our own pace. Life here is simpler and time moves slower, a world away from the usual chaos which reminds us of what travel used to be like.

Our top 5 highlights:
‚ú® Endless green rolling hills - our faves are Palindi Piarakuku Hill & Wairinding Hill for sunset!
‚ú® ‚Å†Lapopu Waterfall - an epic 90m multitiered waterfall
‚ú® ‚Å†Ratenggaro Village - one of the most iconic thatched-roof villages on the island
‚ú® Weekuri Lagoon - a hidden oasis with clear turquoise waters
‚ú® Wild horses roaming around the island!

If you‚Äôre a fan of road trips, photography, and deep cultural immersion, and don‚Äôt mind a bit of curated discomfort, Sumba is a perfect fit for you.

The best time to visit is from **May to October**, when the island turns into a golden savannah under clear blue skies. But if you‚Äôre heading there **now in November**, you‚Äôll catch the start of the rainy season - which also means lush greenery, dramatic skies, and quieter roads. Just make sure to plan your trip soon, before the heavier rains arrive in December.

  And if you happen to be around in **February or March**, you might even witness the legendary **Pasola Festival** - a once-a-year celebration whose dates are decided by the appearance of the Nyale worms along West Sumba‚Äôs shores. It‚Äôs one of those rare events you can‚Äôt really plan for, but that makes it all the more special when you stumble upon it.
