i think this is a concept that i can learn more about, essentially, more prominent for big events when i was younger like exams, competitions etc, but overtime this has mainly dwindled to things im not as confident in.

i no longer feel jittery before a competition, nor exam for that matter. i mainly have jitters when meeting new people or public speaking.

funny enough it’s not that i have a fear of either, it’s just the leading up that makes me nervous. i’m sure there’s a better term for it.
