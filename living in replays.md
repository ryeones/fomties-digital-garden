`i like rewatching episodes or movies i really enjoy, almost in a way going back in time to feel that sense of peace especially when im stressed`

this is a situation i often find myself in. its interesting to me because it applies in various aspects of my life. in the initial note i wrote, it was things like rewatch episodes or movies that i really enjoy.

and even though i know the ending, i know the comedic points, i can most of the time even almost recite on time as the scenes play back, but i still continually rewatch those episodes.

some may think this is a waste of time, and perhaps it is. but there is just some kind of peace of mind or solace that i find, where i can find solitude in the fact that i already know the ending or what's going to happen.

and i often find myself doing this whenever i have something i'm afriad of and am trying to run away from, maybe this is my form of escapism, as even though i know that [[you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.]] , in the current moment, it is always daunting.

and maybe this is why i decided to have [[2 cor 5v7|this verse]] etched on my skin, to remind myself.
