i think referring to my adobe as well as my things 3 situation

one of my [[creative constraints]] or at least [[my intentional effort towards minimalism]] is to always choose the trial or cheaper version of things.

within the x number of days, i'll be able to decide if this is a need or a want, and even if its a need, how much of a need it is

i think similarly, with how prevalent [[shiny object syndrome]] is, we tend to jump to the next newest thing, but instead if we work within our [[creative constraints]] (and eventually form our own [[aesthetic is a creative constraint|aesthetics]]), we can focus on doing the things that actually [[move the needle]] rather than catch ourselves in [[productive procrastination]] by contemplating on whether a tool is worth our money.
