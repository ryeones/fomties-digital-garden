came across this in odessey videos about writing notes, but he was honing in the third benefit of why writing notes after reading or consuming is important - because they help you remember more.

if our learning is easy, like passive, it is easy but you donâ€™t actually remember or digest anything. 

perhaps this can be adjacent idea of how [[clusters cause tension, and tension is required for resolution]] as well as the concept of [[keep your head on it|keeping your head on it]]
