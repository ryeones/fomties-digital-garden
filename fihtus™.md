**2019-2023**

[a small business](https://www.instagram.com/fihtus) i ran from 2019 to 2023 — a custom service where i painted sneakers for people, mostly by hand.

i’m no longer actively marketing it, but i still take on commissions from time to time.

this all started from [scratching my own itch](https://www.instagram.com/p/DIvFbpkzdKk/) after a weekend at a nike outlet - i came across the [nike zoom fly sp x nathan bell collab](https://www.runnersworld.com/gear/a26310893/nike-zoom-fly-nathan-bell/) and couldn’t stop thinking about it.

so i bought a plain pair of air force 1s, painted over them, and posted it online. nothing fancy.
just a [simple colour swap](https://www.instagram.com/p/B7eHm6Pn3uz/?hl=en) - but to my surprise, i started getting dms. a few friends, some strangers. small requests. then more.

somehow, it became a side business.

i listed simple designs on [thecustommovement](https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/05/this-startup-wants-to-democratize-custom-sneaker-ownership/) (now shut down — but [artcustommovement](https://artcustommovement.com/) feels similar today). my instagram became the place to showcase more bespoke pieces - everything from [jordans](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCPozVGgRUb/?hl=en&img_index=1) to [blazers](https://www.instagram.com/p/CPcjdgkLEYD/?hl=en&img_index=1).

simple designs started at $120 (excluding the base shoes). 
more complex ones went for $250 and up.

as a solo founder, i wore every hat:
customer service, design, marketing, shipping, packaging - all while still a student.
it was the first time i understood how content could drive a business.
and it was also what got me posting more consistently, and [showing my work](https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/), documenting as i went.

fihtus™ isn’t active anymore. but every now and then, i still think about reviving it -
not to scale, 
not to brand,
just for the joy of making something with my hands again.

[[2025-10-26-what i’ve learnt from running a small business 5 years ago|here are 3 lessons]] i carry from this project:

1. build fast, adapt faster. nothing was ever perfect, but shipping beat waiting.
2. businesses solve problems. your product is just the vehicle.
3. get good at one thing, then sell different levels of access to it (something i later conceptualised as a "[[digital coffeeshop]]")
