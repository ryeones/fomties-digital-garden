euscape started as a branding concept - first explored in a university module, but rooted in years of personal reflection. 

what began as a semester-long branding project slowly turned into a mini content experiment - a theme page that curated thought-led content around self-awareness, perspective shifts, and the inner life.

the idea was simple:
create a quiet, faceless space online for emotional clarity, introspection, and everyday reflection.

especially as someone who grew up in a culture where vulnerability wasn’t the default, this was meant to be the kind of space i wished existed.

euscape is no longer actively maintained, but here's an [archive of the page](https://www.instagram.com/euscape) and [[2025-10-29-what i've learnt from trying to grow a theme page from scratch|the journey from this "failed" project]]
