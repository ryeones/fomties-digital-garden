euscape started as a branding concept - first explored in a university module, but rooted in years of personal reflection. 

what began as a semester-long branding project slowly turned into a mini content experiment - a theme page that curated thought-led content around self-awareness, perspective shifts, and the inner life.

the idea was simple:
create a quiet, faceless space online for emotional clarity, introspection, and everyday reflection.

especially as someone who grew up in a culture where vulnerability wasn’t the default, this was meant to be the kind of space i wished existed.

my intention with euscape was to:
	•	build community through faceless, intentional content
	•	curate thought leadership without positioning myself as the face(less)
	•	design an ecosystem around reflection, motivation, and calm
	•	eventually extend into a newsletter, digital products, and email flows

beyond just an aesthetic page, euscape was a branding exercise in emotional resonance and a playground for me to explore storytelling, content strategy, and what it means to create space online.

euscape is no longer actively maintained, but if you want to look at the archival of videos i've created, you can check
