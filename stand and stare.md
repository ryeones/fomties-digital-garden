this was a poem recommended by my grab driver during out conversation across the island.

i haven't had time to check it out but he did say it was basically about how we tend to [[live life on autopilot]] and forget to be grateful of the little things in life.

this is definitely a mantra and way of life i feel is so important, hence i made sure to note it down the moment he said it.
