if you’re tired of the same old date ideas in singapore…
try making stained glass together.

this is yenni, and she runs 
singapore’s first stained glass workshop -
where you can make your own suncatcher from over 50 different designs.

she’s super sweet and patient, 
giving clear instructions 
but also space to try things out.

she willingly shares her own journey of running this cosy little studio,
which felt like we were hanging out with a friend.

and the best part about this seek sophie experience is 
being able to solder the glass pieces together with fire
and seeing your ideas turn into reality.

yenni also snaps photos throughout,
so you'll have memories to take home along with
your minature stained glass window.

so if you're looking for a new date idea, check out the link in our bio!
