dato app worth? 

think about ss properly

plan content especially less filler and more thought leadership

difference between monthly and weekly marketing recap
- refer to past docs, otherwise have to ask jia lin tomorrow
- honestly didn't have fking time at all this round but nonetheless should have produced better work - no comments there
- in general, again about traingulating data, hypothesis and analysis, no point just showing and telling

*when comparing two posts*
- if my hypothesis is the quality of clips, then make sure there is something to back it up
- if easily another post can be seen to deny it, then have to dig deeper - or mayb there are more than one factors, and traingulate them

aunty pek/sabrina/the kueh lady
- during the interview itself should dig deeper, find the angle and pull out things that are really crucial to make people care
- even if let's say no time or don't have live recording, can ask them on whatasapp, and maybe voice record or something then send to ask for vo.
- retention editing, not just simple pictures on screens, make use of transitions more. (honestly idk what's on brand for them)
- changes in text colour when question asked vs answered
- initial hook of sabrina
	- elluded to something but deosn't relaly hone in too muhc
	- won't get to anywhere and hook won't be strong
	- if we wanna say something about the singapore government about gambling and culutre, then hone it even more rather than half fuck

for team building 
- think about what are some common factors that will make people want to buy or watch?
- think about people interested in either teambuilding activities or people ordering these for their team for example
- some possible factors include:
	- timelyness, voice over vs text on screen, creator clips vs unclear,
	- price, ambience, amount of intereaction between each other,

month on month calculated as y/x - 1 x 100%? confirm again so that there i'm sure in the future

ask krissten if she still needs help with downloading vimeo videos
need to backlog on the past few socials to youtube to listings

for top of funnel 400 likes for main considered well done
bottom of funnel 200-300 likes considered well (for more on brand stuff)

top of funnel content is important, but trying to not be over reliant on filler tofu content since anlaytics wise it doesn't show that it is resulting in followers

people follow them for seek sophie pov + thought leadership in the space, so have to look for more of such specific content in the future rather than just typical top of funnel

ask krissten on sop for youtube uploads
