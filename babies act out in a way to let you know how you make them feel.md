why did i even give birth to you

i hate you, i donâ€™t want you 

this is a response of an adolescent to their parents.

how does this relate to v young kids and dogs?

perhaps if this is actually true, that this is how kids communicate, then maybe it is easier to decipher what babies or dogs are trying to tell us, especially since they are not at the stage capable of talking.
