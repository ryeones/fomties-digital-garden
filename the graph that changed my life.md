i was watching this video by [[daniel barada]] called [[Daniel Barada â€“ the graph that changed my life forever]]  and there was this concept in one of his section where talked about the graph that changed his life.

> imagine two lines on a graph. one line is how well you remember what you did. the other is how much return you get from it.
> 
> in the beginning, memory is high, and results are low. you just started meditating for example, so you remember every session, but you feel like it's doing nothing.
> 
> years go by. you're calm, focused, and emotionally centered. but you don't even remember how it started.
> 
> this is where most people lose the game. they give up early, while memory is still high, but results haven't kicked in. 
> 
> they start believing it's all pointless, right before the curve was about to explode upward.

and i found this concept to be so interesting because it something that is of a similar vein to [[you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.]], 

and since we're technically unable to know when 'our graph is going to explode', it often ends up with us [[living in replays]], or at least in this case, this is where i often find myself trying to find some solace in uncertain situations especially about the future.
