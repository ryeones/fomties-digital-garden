this is a concept especially useful when confronting a disagreement.

for the most part, people dislike feeling wrong, and may often fight back.

so instead, one common way is to let them feel in control of the conversation, by giving them an out, a less embarssing way compared to if they were forced to admit and say "yes i am wrong"

at the same time, this allows you to also say your piece.

i'll try to include a situation the next time i work on this note
