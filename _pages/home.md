**ryan tham aka ryeones.**

*telling stories. sparks, strategies, sequences, stories, systems, spaces.*

currently, i'm the content strategist & storyteller of [seeksophie](https://www.seeksophie.com), helping brands tell honest stories and connect with the people who matter.

outside of work, i'm building [soffcopy™](https://www.soffcopy.com) and [fomties™](https://www.fomties.com) the goal was always to somewhat get a 9-5, to fund my 5-9, to eventually escape the 9-5.

soffcopy shares the stories of inspiring founders and creatives, offering alternate paths beyond the traditional route. fomties is a personal archive documenting the messy, evolving process of figuring out my twenties.

both are projects i wish my younger self had found sooner and the stories i'd want him to hear.

previously, i studied architecture at the national university of singapore and [[press|played floorball at a competitive level all my life.]]
