hey there!

i have an open invite (also commonly termed as [[standing invitation]]) for you to email me about anything that's on your mind.

i have a couple of email addresses for personal and professional use, but the one that i will check the most often is ryan@ryeones.com.

***why am i doing this? (even though no one will probably ask)***

i love helping people, sharing what i know, learning from others and just bouncing ideas around. anything from your first weekend project, to something of a bigger scale - i wanna see and be part of it!

since i was young, i've always been afraid to ask questions, especially those who have been through challenges i was currently facing - even though its the most direct way to cut down on time wasted and navigate certain problems.

nonetheless, whether it was due to my shy personality or environment that made it harder to ask - it was still my personal journey and i'm grateful for every part of the process (both wins and losses). however this open invite today is my extending a hand out first, for those who may find it useful. it's the [[huh, so what is this|same sentiment]] i had when starting this personal website, and also the sole reason i was able to even [[vibe code]] everything so far by [[standing on the shoulders of giants]].

***emails i like getting***

i have a few areas of interests where i may be of use for you, generally at the intersection of visual design, content creation and marketing.

- your business, marketing or content strategy
- building indie businesses and community
- creative design feedback (i'm more of a "[[think out of the box]]" person than a professional in a specific field)
- content strategy to gain your [[1000 true fans]]

*other stuff i like talking about*

- your niche interests, hobbies, or your job
- floorball, football or anything sports
- [figuring out your twenties!!!](https://www.fomties.com)
- books! i wouldn't mind a couple book reccomendations
- content creation and visual storytelling (i have a genuine interest in documenting and sharing)
- travelling and digital nomad tips - i aspire to be one!

***here's the catch?***

i am unfortunately a combination of 1. bad at juggling emails (trying to improve), and 2. i'm pretty bad at emails - so here's just some
i have the unfortunate combination of a) being bad at email, and b) getting a reasonable amount of email. let me set your expectations.

*will definitely get a response*

- you send me a personally written email about something that clearly matters to you
- you send me a direct and interesting email about something that i am well-suited to answer
- you want me to look at something you’ve made
- you ask for feedback on an idea
- you're looking to collab in some way, shape or form
- you ask for a refund on a purchase

*will sometimes get a response*

- vague or long-winded emails. depends on how well i really manage my emails that week
- you ask me to help with a script, editing or a full content strategy
- you’re a recruiter (i’m not looking for work at the moment, but there are people around me who are looking - so i might as well introduce both of you.)

*will not get a response*

- i’m clearly on some kind of list
- you’ve spamming
- you’re asking me to participate in some survey or test

**important!** if i don’t respond within a week (i try to check my emails everyday during my [[shut down routine]]), feel free to send a follow-up email. i probably just got busy on the day (or even week) your email came through. if you follow up and ask me to reply, i’ll genuinely do my best to write you back.

*don’t know how to start?*
if you feel like emailing me but don’t know how to start, here’s your opening line…

hey there,
i'm sending you this email because of the open invite page on your website.
i need help with/i want your thoughts on/i'd like to share...
