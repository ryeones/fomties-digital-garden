i’m currently the content strategist and storyteller at [seeksophie](https://www.seeksophie.com/about) - my first full-time role after graduating with a bachelor’s degree in architecture from the national university of singapore.

i’ve lived in singapore all my life. for the most part, i followed the traditional path - decent grades, safe choices, predictable steps.

but when i chose to study architecture, it was the first leap of faith i ever took. something more creative. less maths. more risk.

but after my first lesson, i knew i’d made a mistake.

instead of switching courses, i chose to push through - and document the entire journey.

that decision [[my story|ended up changing everything]]

since then, i’ve run a custom shoe business, touched seven figures flipping jpegs (yes, nfts), and played floorball at a competitive level all my life.

i think a lot. i over-plan. but more than anything, i’ve learned to take action - and show up consistently, even when it’s messy.

i don’t like to bucket myself into one category. i design. i vibe-code. i tell stories. i create experiences. but at the core, everything i do is about documenting journeys, sharing stories, and helping people feel a little less alone.

i don’t have it all figured out, but i’m building in public, one honest post at a time.

the quickest way to reach me is via [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ryeones). if you prefer a different medium, you can [email me](mailto:ryan@ryeones.com). i check it every few days.
