title: huh, so what is this
---
uhh haha good question.

its just an informal website,

a playground for my thoughts,

an archive, maybe even a blog, whatever.

this is mainly for documenting and sharing -

my two favourite hobbies, aside from many others.

no page here will ever be fully complete,

it will never be actually.

this is a space for imperfection and endless refinement ,

rawness and abstraction.

a place for communication with myself,

and for those who stumble across them,

and typos and sentences that end with no resolution,

and of course, lower caps

if you can’t tell.

at the moment, i’m championing for light mode,

i’ll question our friendship if you actually use dark mode (and android)

but just know that a couple months ago i favoured dark over light.

and of course, i like lower caps,

pastel colours, and emojis as well.

but at the same time, i’m a minimalist at heart

- black and white,

nothing too extravagant.

this page could evolve too

i might wake up one day and decide i don’t want anyone reading this

and delete it all.

but i might also wake up one day,

and notion changes their terms of service

or developers no longer maintain this code 😭

who knows, even i don’t lol.

there might have been more things on here that i removed

because it was just a little too private for it to be in public

or it could just be the first time i’m writing anything here.

(its not, definitely not)

or i’m just making room for the mystery and possibility of all of the above

everything on this site is a work in progress

everything is a trial and error

i am not a writer, i can’t write for nuts

but i am a thinker, and problem solver.

i think deeply, and reflect on everything that i come across

no matter how big or small it may seem

i just like seeing where things can go

thank u for being here

dm me if u have any thoughts.

**-how to get around this site-**

not sure what brought you here, but i've set up a few ways to explore, so you'll find something interesting no matter your reason:

1. [[changelog]] - to quickly get an overview overview of the most recent changes to the website

2. quick links - curated pages that hopefully add value to your visit 

3. [[tags|what i write about]] - check out my (topics i write about for top level) maps of content

4. [[home]] - let the interconnected notes guide you through my digital garden

if you just want the latest scoop on what's going on, check out what i'm up to [[now]], which serves as a [[now page]].
