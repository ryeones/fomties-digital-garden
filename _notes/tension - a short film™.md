this was a short film project that i had to film for an individual assignment in my final year and semester studying at the national university of singapore.

the brief was to *create a short film to be shot with your smartphone camera based on the topic - "a day in the life", where the film is fully produced individually.*

the filming took place on a weekend trip to [[johor bahru]] at a unit in the airbnb i usually stay at - [[midvalley southkey mosaic]].

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">the pull between starting and stopping.the creative process is rarely a straight path. it's a cycle of momentum and hesitation, drive and doubt. tension captures that internal struggle of a creator-the weight of an idea, the thrill of inspiration, the grip of procrastination, and the moment of release. for everyone caught between ambition and uncertainty, this is a reflection of the fight to finish.</mark>

you can either watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyXrPKzx_Bk) on youtube or on my site itself
