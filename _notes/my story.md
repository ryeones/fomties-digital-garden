at 19, i started a custom shoe business out of my bedroom.  
i had no marketing budget.  
no fancy gear.  
  
i just knew i wanted to create - and somehow share that journey.  
but honestly, i was too shy to talk to the camera.  
  
so i started quietly.  
posting process shots, packaging videos, and honest captions about the work.  
  
that was my way of showing up.  
and slowly, people started paying attention.  
  
it made me realise - i didn’t just enjoy designing.  
i loved sharing the story behind the things i made.  
  
that curiosity about content followed me into university.  
i studied architecture at the national university of singapore.  
and i knew pretty early on that it wasn’t the path for me.  
  
but i saw it as another chance.  
to document. to connect. to tell stories again.  
  
so i kept sharing - the late nights, the critiques, the small wins.  
and slowly again - people started resonating.  
  
along the way, i built a small but steady audience of over 18,000 across tiktok and instagram.  
not overnight.  
but from years of being consistent, honest, and showing up even when it was messy.  
  
outside of my own personal brand, i interned at a short-form content agency.  
took on freelance social media projects.  
did everything from market research to scripting, editing, and content strategy.  
  
through all this, i was also a full-time national floorball athlete.  
it taught me how to work under pressure, stay disciplined, and be a good team player —  
skills i now carry into every creative collaboration.  
  
i’ve always been drawn to innovation -  
the excitement of trying new things, building from scratch, taking creative risks.  
  
that mindset led me to being into early web3 communities like bayc, azuki, and doodles —  
not just for the hype,  
but because i was curious about how people rally around shared ideas and identities.  
  
what i’ve learned is this:  
trends come and go.  
but what really makes a project last through market cycles -  is storytelling.  
  
the ability to build connection,  
share a vision,  
and create something people genuinely care about.  
  
and that’s what i keep coming back to.  
  
today, i’m focused on helping brands, creators, and founders tell their stories authentically.  
not just chasing trends - but building real connection.  
turning followers into fans.  
and content into something that actually means something.  
  
that’s the path i’m on.  
and i’m just getting started.
