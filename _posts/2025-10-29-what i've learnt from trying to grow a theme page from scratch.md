one of my many mini ventures - conceptualised over years, but executed for less than six months. 
technically, a failure. but one i learnt a lot from.

it began as part of a branding module in my final year at university.
as an architecture student who chose not to pursue my master’s, i found myself drawn to branding, marketing, and content modules instead.

our assignment was to build a digital product brand from scratch.
and for me, that brand was euscape.

[[euscape|the idea had been living in my head for years]] - as someone who grew up in a culture where vulnerability wasn’t always encouraged (especially as an asian guy), i often felt like there wasn’t space to process or reflect, let alone speak openly about it.

that’s what euscape was meant to be - a quiet corner (on the internet) for introspection, motivation, and emotional clarity. years later, that same thread would lead me to start [[fomties™]].

after the module ended, i decided to keep going.
i turned euscape into a [theme page](https://www.instagram.com/euscape) - a faceless curation project designed to build community through thought-led storytelling. 

as you can already tell, with most of my creative projects, the root motivation stems from personal circumstances or problems i wanted solving. for this second phase of euscape, it was to improve my technical knowledge and skills.

i wanted it to:
	•	sharpen my video editing, curation and storytelling skills
	•	deepen my expertise in content marketing and strategy by trying to grow a faceless brand from zero
	•	and eventually monetise through a [[digital coffeeshop]] through newsletters, email flows, brand collaborations, and digital products etc.

i had a rough roadmap.
some might say i even planned too much.
a couple of daily actionable steps.
some but within two months, i burnt out.

some days i look back and feel like i failed.
but i also know this project gave me [[2025-10-29-what i've learnt from trying to grow a theme page from scratch|valuable reps in content marketing, audience building, and system design]] - all of which i use today.

not everything is meant to scale.
some ideas exist to teach you what matters when you try again.


long story short here are my key takeaways:
1. you never really start from zero
2. discipline will out last motivation everytime
3. smart goals and actionable steps are the first step, but systems help keep things running
4. no business ever has a plan fully thought out, maybe some rough plans but more improtantly is to build fast and adap faster and of course keep going regardless
