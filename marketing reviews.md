quarter review is overview of 3 months - from the big picture

monthly review 

weekly review is quick review

main goal for socials is to grow followers, jess talk about my monday shirt again

think about why the numbers are like these - whether its followers, comments, shares, saves etc

for this month due to maggi's trip? any other reasons?

for indiviudal posts (look at top 3 and bottom 3) - shares and repost can combine vs share to story, follows, link clicks (likes not a priority), 

high likes no follows or some kind of outlier, try to rationalise - is it a trend maybe not so much heart put into it 

maybe can give suggestion for last minute kind of work?

briefly taalk about last week stuff maybe
