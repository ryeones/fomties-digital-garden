i've redacted a great chunk of information but this was essentially the initial seed of idea i had which resulted into the dual project - [[euscapeâ„¢]]

- brand that was first conceptualised few years back 
- knew the general aesthetic i was going for 
- few years later, an opportunity came and i was completing a branding project about it as a school assignment 
- today is the presentation for it 
- have started an instagram and tiktok page for it as well as a beehive landing page
- i want to try building a brand, it may take sometime but this time i want to see it through 
- as for now this is the bio for the brand
