this happened during a debrief of one of my league match, without going into the details of the actual comments said, i just thought this was an interesting [[school of thought]] and something i’ve battled for very long.

sure often as a [[general rule of thumb]], or even when we make sweeping statements like these, where if someone who’s juggling x number of responsibilities in life still can commit to a certain thing or produce a certain quality of work, there’s no reason that someone with half of his responsibility can’t do the same.

on one hand, there’s so much truth in this. i [[think through a convergent lens]], it makes absolute sense.

1 + 1 ‎ = 2 so 0 + 1 ‎ = 1, hence it should take less effort.

however sometimes i think is this really the case? sure on a surface level it makes sense, but individually, we have our strengths, abilities, emotions etc, how can we be so sure that just because having lesser responsibility would mean easier or less effort required?

not exactly the same as [[one man’s poison is another man’s gold]], but along the same vein, that we are all different, what works for one may or may not work for another.
