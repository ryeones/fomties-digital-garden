the seats in the buses in singapore are facing the direction of travel. a single and double decker bus have different seat configuration, the upper deck manages to fit many more seats compared to the lower half even taking into consideration a space for handicaps.

rationale i thought about was there due to the presence of bus wheels and engine, the layout was slightly limiting, but then again the front of the bus isn’t laid out the same either. just realised that requires a space up for the stairs so i guess that explains it.

trains have seats for perpendicular to direction of travel. not sure why, but rational as to why there’s more space made in trains because taking one stop via a train is much more different than for bus, more people would do the former
